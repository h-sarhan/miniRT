3D computer graphics project for 42 Abu Dhabi, built using the C programming language and MiniLibX.

# About

MiniRT is a 3D rendering software based on the ray tracing algorithm. The subject only requires you to render static images based on a text file describing the scene. A lot of our time was spent working on additional features focused on real-time interactivity in the 3D environment.

# Features
