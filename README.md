3D computer graphics project for 42 Abu Dhabi, built using the C programming language and MiniLibX.

# About

MiniRT is a 3D rendering software based on the ray tracing algorithm. The subject only requires you to render static images based on a text file describing the scene. A lot of our time was spent working on additional features focused on real-time interactivity in the 3D environment.

# Features
## Mandatory

* Rendering of 3D shapes like spheres, cylinders and planes
* Set shape properties like height, radius, position, and orientation before rendering
* Set camera position and orientation before rendering
* Set point light position, color, and intensity before rendering
* Phong model of lighting using ambient, diffuse, and specular components
* Shadows

## Bonus

* Edit mode: Edit shape properties like position, orientation, scale, and color in real-time
* Camera mode: Move camera around the scene
* Light mode: Edit light properties
* Mouse controls: Move and rotate objects around with mouse input
* Look at animation: The camera pans to an object when you press a button
* Multi-threaded rendering
* Spotlights
* Patterns
* Diffuse and normal texture mapping
* Additional shapes: Cone and cube
* Reflections
* Anti Aliasing
